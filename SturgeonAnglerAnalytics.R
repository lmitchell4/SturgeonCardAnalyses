# This file creates a dataframe of all purchased sturgeon cards from desired
# years (e.g., 2013 to 2015). Anglers are classified as "avid" when an angler
# has purchased a sturgeon card in at least 2 consecutive years. Data are
# analyzed to show for which years anglers did not return to the Department
# his/her report card.

# SQL Queries -------------------------------------------------------------

# create a list of sql queries; list must be named and dataframe(s) will be
# added to the global environment using that name

# Data Connection and Data Import -----------------------------------------

# This section opens connection to SQL Server database that houses sturgeon 
# report card data from 2012 to present. The database is queried, and for each 
# query a dataframe is created in the global environment. The connection is 
# closed and dataframes are available for analyses.

# will prompt for user ID and password
QuerySqlServerDb(queries = stu_angler_query_list["PurchasedCards"],
                 server_name = "74.120.125.240",
                 database = "CA", trusted = FALSE)

# Data Analytics ----------------------------------------------------------

AnglerAvidity <- GetAvidityData(card_data = PurchasedCards, only_avid = TRUE)

# result should be 0
length(unique(AnglerAvidity$CustomerID)) - length(AnglerAvidity$CustomerID)

# Get customer names contact ----------------------------------------------

# add to query list the parameter query to get customer names contact based on
# customer ID (05-Oct-2015)

# parameter is too big - does not work see 
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177682.aspx; somewhere between 30K 
# and 33K records is where things seem to go sideways (06-Oct-2015); the quick 
# work around will be to run 30K records and then run the rest rbinding one to 
# the other (J. DuBois 06-Oct-2015)

# Duh!!!! Didn't even think of getting random number of records first AND then
# querying the database for customer info!!! There's really no point to getting
# contact information for all anglers and then randomly choosing from that list!
# Might reconfigure this soon (J. DuBois 06-Oct-2015)

# prior to below will also need to subset AnglerAvidity dataframe to remove
# anglers where nYearsNotRet = 0; no point in calling these folks since they've
# returned their Cards

# query below errored when number of records exceeded ~30K; because we want a
# random sample of anglers, the thinking now is to perform the random sample AND
# THEN query the database for angler name, contact info of the randomly sampled
# CustomerIDs (J. DuBois 07-Oct-2015)

# below merges both dataframes and then from the merged dataframe outputs a
# random selection of records from which the phone survey can be conducted; this
# is not the best design, but for now it does work and I may tweak with it in
# the future (J. DuBois, 06-Oct-2015)
