# This file creates a dataframe of all purchased sturgeon cards from desired
# years (e.g., 2013 to 2015). Anglers are classified as "avid" when an angler
# has purchased a sturgeon card in at least 2 consecutive years. Data are
# analyzed to show for which years anglers did not return to the Department
# his/her report card.

# Data Connection and Data Import -----------------------------------------

# query a dataframe is created in the global environment. The connection is 
# closed and dataframes are available for analyses.

# will prompt for user ID and password

# Get customer names contact ----------------------------------------------

# add to query list the parameter query to get customer names contact based on
# customer ID (05-Oct-2015)

# parameter is too big - does not work see 
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177682.aspx; somewhere between 30K 
# and 33K records is where things seem to go sideways (06-Oct-2015); the quick 
# work around will be to run 30K records and then run the rest rbinding one to 
# the other (J. DuBois 06-Oct-2015)

# Duh!!!! Didn't even think of getting random number of records first AND then
# querying the database for customer info!!! There's really no point to getting
# contact information for all anglers and then randomly choosing from that list!
# Might reconfigure this soon (J. DuBois 06-Oct-2015)

# prior to below will also need to subset AnglerAvidity dataframe to remove 
# anglers where nYearsNotRet = 0; no point in calling these folks since they've 
# returned their Cards; added (17-Nov-2015 - removal of anglers where only card
# not returned is 2015 - as these Cards not due until 31-Jan-2016)
