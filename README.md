This project contains analytics on Sturgeon Fishing Report Card (Card) data. The results of some of these analytics are presented in the summary reports generated anually around mid-March.

Other analytics pertain to an angler survey designed to help understand the effects of non-reported (i.e., when an angler does not return his/her Card or does not report on-line).
